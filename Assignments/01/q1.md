# Question 1: Analysis of Turing’s “Computing Machinery & Intelligence
## Objections That Still Carry Some Weight:
Alan Turing’s 1950 paper “Computing Machinery & Intelligence”, is one of, if not the most influential works documented in modern history about Artificial Intelligence. Turing proposes the Imitation Game which is now known as the famous “Turing Test”, as a necessary litmus test for machine intelligence. Turing also addresses several key objections made toward machine intelligence, by not only highlighting them but also providing strong refutations to make the case for why machine intelligence is not a fantasy but a forthcoming technological reality. 

Numerous of Turing’s objections continue to be relevant in today’s technologically advanced world, especially including the following:
* __The Mathematical Objection__: This argumentation was framed around Gödel’s incompleteness theorem, which suggested that there are certain truths that humans can identify but a machine could not be able to. Turing refuted this argument by stating that humans are also limited in a similar capacity, but modern-day AI research has indicated that artificial intelligence systems are still struggling with developing their reasoning beyond their equipped training data. Indicating yet again that machine intelligence may always be limited in certain fundamental ways. 
* __The Argument from Consciousness__: The question of whether a machine is truly capable of thinking or whether it merely simulates the thinking process remains an unresolved philosophical debate. At the time, Turing refuted this objection by emphasizing external behavior over internal behavior/experience, but modern-day advancements in neuroscience & cognitive science have suggested that intelligence and consciousness may be deeply intertwined, making this objection still carry weight as it highlights the distinction between simulated intelligence and genuine understanding.
* __The Argument from Informality of Behavior__: The basis of this argumentation was based on the fact that human beings exhibit unpredictable behavior whilst machines follow a programmed set of rules and instructions. Turing argued that machines could be programmed to also exhibit unpredictable behavior through randomness & adaptive learning. But even today, the most advanced AI systems operate within rigid frameworks and have not yet convincingly crossed the barrier of human cognition that involves intuition, creativity, and complex social understanding.

## Validity of Turing’s Refutations:
At the time of publishing this paper, Turing effectively refuted several objections to machine intelligence, whilst some of his counterarguments did lay a foundation for further discourse on those objections. 
* __The Theological Objection__: Turing’s refutation to the argument that intelligence is a God-given attribute, gifted to human beings as a unique attribute; was that this perspective arbitrarily limits the definition of intelligence and that if God chose to grant intelligence to machines, there would be no further contradiction. This refutation has remained valid over the years, as modern debates and discussions have moved towards the ethics and autonomy of artificial intelligence rather than religious exclusivity of thought. 
* __Argument of Consciousness__: Turing’s refutation to the Argument from Consciousness was to dismiss any subjective experience as irrelevant. While this allowed for AI to develop unimpeded by metaphysical concerns, modern discussions of AI ethics and sentience suggest that dismissing consciousness entirely may be premature.
* __The “Head in the Sand” Objection__: Here Turing dismisses the fear of machine intelligence as dangerous machines, by pointing out that this is just mere emotionally wishful thinking. This argument still stands to be valid today, where AI development now is being and should be guided by ethical considerations rather than emotion-based or fear-based considerations.

## New Objections Arising From Developments:
Since the time of Turing’s publishing of this paper, AI has evolved tenfold, and with that evolution, new challenges have arisen on the surface, that we face today such as:
* __The Explainability Objection__: Modern-day AI especially deep learning models operate as a “black box”, where AI researchers are struggling to fully understand how certain models can reach their respective conclusions, which creates turbulence in the notion of whether machines can be trusted as intelligent agents. 
* __The Control Problem__: AI systems, especially the new autonomous ones, have presented risks if they were to surpass human control, issues related to AI safety, and potential existential threats that were not addressed in Turing’s paper
* __The Embodiment Objection__: Some researchers argue that intelligence requires a body to meaningfully interact with the world, as AI right now remains largely disembodied, unlike human cognition which is shaped by physical and sensory experiences.

## Evaluating Turing’s 2000 Prediction:
Turing predicted that by the year 2000, a machine would have a 30% chance of passing a five-minute Turing Test with an unskilled interrogator. This prediction was not entirely correct, but it was certainly not entirely wrong either:
* __Partial Sucess__: In limited short interactions chatbots like ELIZA and IBM’s Watson and GPT-based models have come closer to passing the Turing Test. In 2014, the Eugene Goostman chatbot allegedly passed a Turing test by fooling 33% of human judges in a five-minute conversation. This may partly be true of the consequence that these systems tend to rely on tricks rather than genuine understanding, regardless this stands as a partial success to the prediction made by Turing. 
* __Limitations__: AI systems today still struggle with deep intertwined reasoning, contextual understanding, and the ability to maintain consistency over longer interactions. While AI can mimic human conversation quite convincingly in controlled environments, it often lacks true comprehension and genuine understanding.
