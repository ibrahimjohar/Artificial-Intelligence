# Question 3
The Hospital Patient Monitoring System is an AI-driven system that continuously monitors a patient’s vital signs, stays alert to detect any anomalies, and alerts medical staff in case of emergencies. It can collect data from medical sensors attached to the patient. That data is then analyzed in real-time and then it provides real-time feedback to the healthcare providers. On top of that, it could suggest early intervention strategies for critical diseases for the patient by analyzing the patient’s historical data. 
The Environment for this is:
* Partially Accessible: The agent has access to real-time patient data from medical devices and sensors, but it may be in the dark when it comes to external factors such as the patient’s subjective symptoms. 
* Non-Deterministic but Stochastic: The same inputs don’t always yield the same outcomes due to variations in a patient’s health conditions, there can also be sensor malfunctionings/inaccuracies and unpredictable medical complications.
* Not Episodic but Sequential: The agent's decisions are dependent on past patient data trends, which require continuous monitoring rather than treating each complication/situation as an isolated event.
* Not Static but Dynamic: The patient’s condition changes over time, requiring the agent to adapt continuously to new patient data and the patient’s evolving medical situations.
* Continuous: Vital signs and other health-oriented parameters are constantly changing, which requires real-time processing of incoming data streams.

A Hybrid AI Architecture is most suitable for this domain, that will incorporate:
* Reinforcement Learning - adapting to new complications based on previous patient data trends.
* Machine Learning for Patient Profiling - identifying risk patterns and predicting potential health issues.
* Natural Language Processing - interpreting doctors’ & nurses queries regarding the patient’s health
* Medical Rule-Based Systems - ensuring that there is compliance with medical protocols and guidelines for patient care.
